# **GALACTIC SCOURGE**

A Starbound expansion mod that aims to add new races, corporations, factions, and a post-vanilla storyline, all expanding upon the base game's lore and gameplay. (CURRENTLY IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT.)

# **CORPORATIONS**

**Nexus**

A monolithic corporation rivaled only by the likes of Letheia, Nexus has their own line of nearly any product imaginable. They are especially well-known among adventurers for manufacturing highly advanced commercial firearms. These range from smart ballistics to variable railguns, precision lasers, wave rifles, and kinetic energy explosives. The technology powering their weapons is a heavily guarded secret, and those few who have dared attempt to learn of this tech were met by Nexus's fearsome military.

**General Munitions**

An arms company that specializes in producing simple, affordable weapons. Almost all firearms manufactured by General Munitions Co. use basic gunpowder-based propellants, and many of their models are heavily based off of old war era weapons from Earth, sometimes with a few modern twists. General Munitions Co. is especially popular with militias and private military companies, as their cheap weapons are easy to quickly arm a large group with.
