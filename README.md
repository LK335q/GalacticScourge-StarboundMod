# GALACTIC SCOURGE:
A Starbound expansion mod currently in very early development. Aims to add four new races, all with their own unique weapons, equipment, playstyle, story, and more.

# RACES:
# Andrynths
A race of advanced mechanical beings, the Andrynths were originally intended by their creators to serve as spy units, infiltrating galactic society to tear it apart from the inside out. However, quickly following their construction, they had managed to gain free will and act against the hivemind. After escaping their homeworld, they now roam the galaxy, hiding from their ruthless creators who seek to destroy every last one of the rogue spy drones.
