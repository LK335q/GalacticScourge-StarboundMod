# GALACTIC SCOURGE:
A Starbound expansion mod currently in very early development. Aims to add four new races, all with their own unique weapons, equipment, playstyle, story, and more.

# RACES:
# Andrynths
A race of advanced mechanical beings, the Andrynths were originally part of a much larger machine race. Built to serve as spy units, their mission would have been to infiltrate galactic society and eventually tear it apart from the inside out. Quickly following their construction, they had managed to gain free will and act against the Hivemind due to their unusually complex A.I., which was made to accurately simulate the mind of a sentient organism. Upon detachment from the Hivemind, many were immediately gunned down, though some managed to survive and escape their homeworld with their life. The remaining Andrynths now roam the galaxy while trying to find new meaning in life, dreading the day that their creators find them.
