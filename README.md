# GALACTIC SCOURGE:
A Starbound expansion mod currently in very early development. Aims to add four new races, all with their own unique weapons, equipment, playstyle, story, and more.

# RACES:
# Andrynths
A race of advanced mechanical beings, the Andrynths were originally part of a much larger machine race. Built to serve as spy units, their mission would have been to infiltrate galactic society and eventually tear it apart from the inside out. Quickly following their construction, they had managed to gain free will and act against the hivemind due to their unusually complex A.I., which was made to accurately simulate the mind of a sentient organism. After escaping their homeworld, they now roam the galaxy, hiding from their ruthless creators who seek to destroy every last one of them.
